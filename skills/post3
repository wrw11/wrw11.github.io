        <h2>POST 3</h2>
    
    <p> In the past few days Iâ€™ve done the following: </p>
    
    <p> On 3/1 I watched Photoshop Tutorial--Advance Selection Tools Part 12 (1 hour) Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98PkYv0eehc </p>
    
    <p> This video taught me how to professionally cut out an image (like a person, an object, an animal) and seperate it from its background. 
        It's important I can do this if I want to combine old paintings and newer, funnier, elements from modern times. Also, the video, 
        in and of itself, was only 15 minutes long, but I paused it every so often because I had photoshop open on another computer and was
        trying out the new skills the video taught me. I tried to find a smilar image to the one used in the video to practice the new skills I was taught. </p>

     <p> On 3/2 I watched a YouTube video--Photoshop Lasso Tutorial--Learn how to use the magnetic lasso tool in Photoshop. (1 hour)
       Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXN38p4vcVo </p>
    
      <p> Again, I watched this video because the magnetic lasso tool allows users to select an object in a photo with almost 
          100% accuracy, even though the actual human selection of the object might not be good at all (i.e. photoshop does all
          the work.) Learning the ins and outs of this tool are essential to my goal, and I followed a smiliar structure
          to my last work day, where I paused the video often and fooled around on my own with the skills I had just
          learned. 
        
        <p> Total Time so far: 10 hours. 
        
        <p> Just a note--During Spring Break I hope to use the free time I have to cover for the 10 hours I have left for 
            this skills assignment. I hope to start a project and finish it over break--and maybe I'll watch some more tutorials
            if I need help. </p>
