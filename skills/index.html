    <h2>My Skills Assignment</h2>
    <p>For my self-guided skills assignment, I want to work entirely with Photoshop, and I want my focus to be a satirical take on past movie posters and art masterpieces. I sometimes want to add things subtly to the artwork, so much so that people will have to look at it for a while to see what the joke is, and other times I want the satire to be outrageous (like having Homer from the Simpsons stand in for the screaming guy in Edvard Much’s the Scream). To do this, I’ll have to learn to combine images with different themes in a way that’s funny to a viewer and not confusing. 
</p>
    <p>Below is a list of skills I think will be useful. </p>
    <p>1.	Working with layers (30 minutes) efficiently is of utmost importance if I’m superimposing one picture on top of another. </p>
<p>2.	Using Photoshop brushes (3 hours) like I use real brushes is a skill that’d be great to have, especially if I’m adding to an already completed artwork. The ability to recreate with brushes is another skill.</p>
<p>3.	Alignment (30 minutes) is something I’ve never considered until now, but it seems important. Finding the true “Center” of an image is something I’d like to learn how to do. </p>
<p>4.	Local Pixel Editing and Retouching. (3 hours) Since I’m superimposing one image on top of the other, learning to flawless integrate them on the pixel level is essential. </p>
<p>5.	Custom black and white conversions. (1 hour) I’ve always been a fan of black and white, and changing well-known images or photographs of mine, and incorporating something surprising would be fun. </p>
<p>6.	Smoothing and evening skin (2 hours) would be an interesting one. In fact, just changing the face of another person to create something eerie or different would be cool. </p>
<p>7.	Color modes. (2 Hours) Because this is an easy way to change an image completely. </p>
<p>8.	Learning to create images from scratch using shapes. (2 Hours) Putting cartoon or stick-figure images would be an interesting thing. </p>
<p>9.	Animation. (4 hours) Going back to number 8, combining the animation capabilities with a stick-figure I created.</p>
<p>10.	Combining a painting I created, or I like, with animation. (2 hours). Something that combines still life photography with Photoshop animation interacting with it would be cool. </p>

    <h2>POST 2--2/23</h2>
    
    <p> First of all, I’d like to apologize because this is probably not the right format for these posts. I could not find the learning log sheet mentioned in the rubric. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, in the past few days I’ve done the following: </p>

<p> On 2/20—I watched Lynda.com Exploring Layer Basics ( 8 minutes) </p>

<p> I watched Lynda.com Loading, Selecting, Transforming and Aligning (6 minutes)  </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Working with layer groups (7 minutes) </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Merging and Flattening Layers (5 minutes) </p>

<p> Total: 26 minutes</p>

<p>Reflection: Since I will be combining multiple images to create my photoshopped piece, I think that it is important to understand how layers work. By having a mastery of layers and how they interact with one another in the program, I hope to avoid the layer technical difficulties that have plagued me in previous class work. </p>

<p>After viewing these videos, I now feel confident in my knowledge of how layers work. Admittedly, I have no experience in this matter so far (as I just watched the video and took notes), but I feel as though I have a baseline grasp of the skill.</p>

<p>On 2/21—I watched Color and Brush essentials (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched working with layer masks (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched local pixel editing and retouching (15 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched Bleed mode essential (6 minutes) </p>

<p>Total: 40 Minutes </p>

<p> Again, I only watched the videos at first, but after learning some of these essential skills I doodled on Photoshop for awhile, and since none of my drawings looked good I choose not to save them. I also tried re-drawing my own drawings in Photoshop. (I doodled for 1.5 hours or so.) </p>

<p>On 2/22 I watched Painting “Essentials” By Julieanne Kost  (25 Mins)</p>

<p>On 2/23—Experimentation: (5 hours) After watching the video the days before, I felt ready to try and re-create one of my past paintings because I thought it would be smart to simply recreate a painting at first (to learn how Photoshop works) before altering a masterpiece to make it funny or satirical. I choose to re-create an abstract painting I did awhile ago because I wanted to experiment with all the different brushes and color options. Soon after starting to paint in Photoshop, I realized how difficult painting abstractly is. I had a hard time blending colors naturally, and while it was simple enough to hit command z or the step backwards feature to restart, I was going nowhere. That is, until I started using layers. By putting a picture of my painting in one layer, putting another layer on top of it, then using the eye drop tool and  an acrylic paint set I downloaded off the internet, I was able to (sort of) recreate my painting. While I certainly “cheated” (because I ended up just painting over the colors on my past painting to create a new layer), I still had to do work of my own. I realized soon after that the new layer I created looked nothing like the painting I wanted, so I experimented with the mixer brush tool, the smudge tool, different paint brushes (specifically the splatter brush)-- I also reused portions of the background a few times. Below you can see the picture I painted with real paint, and the picture I painted in Photoshop</p>

    <p>Total time so far: Approximately 8 hours.</p>
