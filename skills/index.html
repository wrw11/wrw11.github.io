    <h2>My Skills Assignment</h2>
    <p>For my self-guided skills assignment, I want to work entirely with Photoshop, and I want my focus to be a satirical take on past movie posters and art masterpieces. I sometimes want to add things subtly to the artwork, so much so that people will have to look at it for a while to see what the joke is, and other times I want the satire to be outrageous (like having Homer from the Simpsons stand in for the screaming guy in Edvard Much’s the Scream). To do this, I’ll have to learn to combine images with different themes in a way that’s funny to a viewer and not confusing. 
</p>
    <p>Below is a list of skills I think will be useful. </p>
    <p>1.	Working with layers (30 minutes) efficiently is of utmost importance if I’m superimposing one picture on top of another. </p>
<p>2.	Using Photoshop brushes (3 hours) like I use real brushes is a skill that’d be great to have, especially if I’m adding to an already completed artwork. The ability to recreate with brushes is another skill.</p>
<p>3.	Alignment (30 minutes) is something I’ve never considered until now, but it seems important. Finding the true “Center” of an image is something I’d like to learn how to do. </p>
<p>4.	Local Pixel Editing and Retouching. (3 hours) Since I’m superimposing one image on top of the other, learning to flawless integrate them on the pixel level is essential. </p>
<p>5.	Custom black and white conversions. (1 hour) I’ve always been a fan of black and white, and changing well-known images or photographs of mine, and incorporating something surprising would be fun. </p>
<p>6.	Smoothing and evening skin (2 hours) would be an interesting one. In fact, just changing the face of another person to create something eerie or different would be cool. </p>
<p>7.	Color modes. (2 Hours) Because this is an easy way to change an image completely. </p>
<p>8.	Learning to create images from scratch using shapes. (2 Hours) Putting cartoon or stick-figure images would be an interesting thing. </p>
<p>9.	Animation. (4 hours) Going back to number 8, combining the animation capabilities with a stick-figure I created.</p>
<p>10.	Combining a painting I created, or I like, with animation. (2 hours). Something that combines still life photography with Photoshop animation interacting with it would be cool. </p>

    <h2>POST 2--2/23</h2>
   

<p> In the past few days I’ve done the following: </p>

<p> On 2/20 From 3:00pm--3:30pm—I watched Lynda.com Exploring Layer Basics ( 8 minutes) </p>

<p> I watched Lynda.com Loading, Selecting, Transforming and Aligning (6 minutes) </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Working with layer groups (7 minutes) </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Merging and Flattening Layers (5 minutes) </p>

<p> Total: 26 minutes</p>

<p>Reflection: Since I will be combining multiple images to create my photoshopped piece, I think that it is important to understand how layers work. By having a mastery of layers and how they interact with one another in the program, I hope to avoid the layer technical difficulties that have plagued me in previous class work. </p>

<p>After viewing these videos, I now feel confident in my knowledge of how layers work. Admittedly, I have no experience in this matter so far (as I just watched the video and took notes), but I feel as though I have a baseline grasp of the skill.</p>

<p>On 2/21 From 10:00am--12:15pm—I watched Color and Brush essentials (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched working with layer masks (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched local pixel editing and retouching (15 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched Bleed mode essential (6 minutes) </p>

<p>Video Total: 40 Minutes </p>

<p> Again, I only watched the videos at first, but after learning some of these essential skills I doodled on Photoshop for awhile, and since none of my drawings looked good I choose not to save them. I also tried re-drawing my own drawings in Photoshop. (I doodled for 1.5 hours or so.) </p>

<p>On 2/22 from 5:00pm--5:30pm I watched Painting “Essentials” By Julieanne Kost  (25 Mins)</p>

<p>On 2/23 from 3:00pm--8:00pm—Experimentation: (5 hours) After watching the video the days before, I felt ready to try and re-create one of my past paintings because I thought it would be smart to simply recreate a painting at first (to learn how Photoshop works) before altering a masterpiece to make it funny or satirical. I choose to re-create an abstract painting I did awhile ago because I wanted to experiment with all the different brushes and color options. Soon after starting to paint in Photoshop, I realized how difficult painting abstractly is. I had a hard time blending colors naturally, and while it was simple enough to hit command z or the step backwards feature to restart, I was going nowhere. That is, until I started using layers. By putting a picture of my painting in one layer, putting another layer on top of it, then using the eye drop tool and  an acrylic paint set I downloaded off the internet, I was able to (sort of) recreate my painting. While I certainly “cheated” (because I ended up just painting over the colors on my past painting to create a new layer), I still had to do work of my own. I realized soon after that the new layer I created looked nothing like the painting I wanted, so I experimented with the mixer brush tool, the smudge tool, different paint brushes (specifically the splatter brush)-- I also reused portions of the background a few times. Below you can see the picture I painted with real paint, and the picture I painted in Photoshop</p>

    <p>Total time so far: Approximately 8 hours.</p>
    
    
    <h2>POST 3</h2>
    
    <p> In the past few days I’ve done the following: </p>
    
    <p> On 3/1 I watched Photoshop Tutorial--Advance Selection Tools Part 12 (1 hour) Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98PkYv0eehc </p>
    
    <p> This video taught me how to professionally cut out an image (like a person, an object, an animal) and seperate it from its background. 
        It's important I can do this if I want to combine old paintings and newer, funnier, elements from modern times. Also, the video, 
        in and of itself, was only 15 minutes long, but I paused it every so often because I had photoshop open on another computer and was
        trying out the new skills the video taught me. I tried to find a smilar image to the one used in the video to practice the new skills I was taught. </p>

     <p> On 3/2 I watched a YouTube video--Photoshop Lasso Tutorial--Learn how to use the magnetic lasso tool in Photoshop. (1 hour)
       Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXN38p4vcVo </p>
    
      <p> Again, I watched this video because the magnetic lasso tool allows users to select an object in a photo with almost 
          100% accuracy, even though the actual human selection of the object might not be good at all (i.e. photoshop does all
          the work.) Learning the ins and outs of this tool are essential to my goal, and I followed a smiliar structure
          to my last work day, where I paused the video often and fooled around on my own with the skills I had just
          learned. 
        
        <p> Total Time so far: 10 hours. 
        
        <p> Just a note--During Spring Break I hope to use the free time I have to cover for the 10 hours I have left for 
            this skills assignment. I hope to start a project and finish it over break--and maybe I'll watch some more tutorials
            if I need help. </p>
  
    <h2> Final Reflection </h2>

<p> From the start, I knew all of the work I wanted to do required Photoshop, so I thought it would be best if I parked myself at a desk in the computer lab often because those computers already had Photoshop downloaded and I work well in computer labs because, unlike when I’m in my dorm room, I’m not tempted to do anything else (such as listen to music, watch YouTube, etc.) </p>

<p> On the first day I went to the computer lab, and on many days after that, I watched some Photoshop tutorials, and while these videos were certainly helpful in some regards, I regret not having more time to fool around with the actual Photoshop software. Those videos on the first day, along with the many other videos I watched after that, were very helpful in teaching me how Photoshop works—and I learned a lot from them. I now feel I can navigate the interface well and I know which tools work best for a lot of situations, but I still wish I had more time to actually create things in the software. Out of my first ten hours, more than 1/4 of my time was spent watching tutorial videos, and it was only after my five hour experimentation session that I realized I learned best by actually trying to paint, draw, or create things—then failing to create them—then trying to do it again, failing again, getting frustrated, troubleshooting, trying again and, if I still had not figured it out yet (which I usually did by this point) I looked up a tutorial to help me. </p>

<p> This just goes to show that, for me, it was best to learn Photoshop through trial and error. By going in semi-blind, making mistakes, and then trying a new tool or tactic, I was able to learn the program much faster than by just watching videos of some expert working through Photoshop flawlessly. This is probably because of two things. First, I sometimes tend to doze off during videos that don’t interest me, and while the capabilities of Photoshop are intriguing, sometimes the technicalities involved can get a little dry. But most of all, Photoshop just has so many ways and tools to alter or create an image that I sometimes felt overwhelmed when learning about them all at once. If I was to do the first ten hours again, I’d probably watch just one video a day and learn about one new tool at a time, then implement that knowledge into my work gradually, instead of just watching a ton of videos and then trying to use everything I learned at once. </p>

<p> In my experiment session during my first ten hours, I tried to re-create an abstract painting of mine and I was happy with the result. It wasn’t a perfect match, of course, but both works had little things about them that I liked. Photoshop allowed me to use splatter brushes better than I could in real life, and by working with layers I could create a more in-depth and “layered” color scheme. However, the real life painting had some inconsistences and brush strokes that I struggled to re-create in the Photoshop software. For my last ten hours, I started off by having a similar three hour experiment session. This time, I set out to alter Vincent Van Goh’s painting called Sorrowing Old Man (At Eternity’s Gate) because I liked the painting and saw that it had potential for comedy. I turned the sorrowing man into Homer Simpson and implied that he was crying because of the newspaper on the floor next to him informing him of the start of prohibition. I am happy with this creation as well, and while I realize it’s not perfect, I am glad that I was able to accomplish my goal of combining a past art piece and pop culture to create humor. </p>

<p> After my three hour experimentation session, surprisingly I went back to a line of tutorial videos. But these ones were different. After spending some time watching Youtube videos for pleasure, a bunch of videos about painting, drawing, and coloring in Photoshop appeared in my suggestions, so I watched a little of the first one and really liked it. Instead of just showing me what tools did what, the people in these videos started with a blank Photoshop canvas and, if you worked alongside them (which you were supposed to do, and I did), by the end of the video you had created your own digital art. Most of the things I drew in Photoshop, thanks to these videos, were cartoon-ish and Anime-like, which is something I hadn’t even considered doing, but really liked. All in all, when I worked in Photoshop alongside the videos (sort of like what I did with painting and Bob Ross), I was able to learn new skills in a new medium I never had experience with before. Plus, most of the time I had a finished drawing by the end that I was proud of. </p>

<p> In sum, I was happy with what I got out of this skills assignment. I accomplished some of the goals I set out for myself and by the end of my hours I had found a new interest: Digital cartoons. </p>
