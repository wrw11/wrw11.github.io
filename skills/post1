<h2>Post 1--My Skills Assignment (Proposal)</h2>

    <p>For my self-guided skills assignment, I want to work entirely with Photoshop, and I want my focus to be a satirical take on past movie posters and art masterpieces. I sometimes want to add things subtly to the artwork, so much so that people will have to look at it for a while to see what the joke is, and other times I want the satire to be outrageous (like having Homer from the Simpsons stand in for the screaming guy in Edvard Much’s the Scream). To do this, I’ll have to learn to combine images with different themes in a way that’s funny to a viewer and not confusing. 

</p>

    <p>Below is a list of skills I think will be useful. </p>

    <p>1.	Working with layers (30 minutes) efficiently is of utmost importance if I’m superimposing one picture on top of another. </p>

<p>2.	Using Photoshop brushes (3 hours) like I use real brushes is a skill that’d be great to have, especially if I’m adding to an already completed artwork. The ability to recreate with brushes is another skill.</p>

<p>3.	Alignment (30 minutes) is something I’ve never considered until now, but it seems important. Finding the true “Center” of an image is something I’d like to learn how to do. </p>

<p>4.	Local Pixel Editing and Retouching. (3 hours) Since I’m superimposing one image on top of the other, learning to flawless integrate them on the pixel level is essential. </p>

<p>5.	Custom black and white conversions. (1 hour) I’ve always been a fan of black and white, and changing well-known images or photographs of mine, and incorporating something surprising would be fun. </p>

<p>6.	Smoothing and evening skin (2 hours) would be an interesting one. In fact, just changing the face of another person to create something eerie or different would be cool. </p>

<p>7.	Color modes. (2 Hours) Because this is an easy way to change an image completely. </p>

<p>8.	Learning to create images from scratch using shapes. (2 Hours) Putting cartoon or stick-figure images would be an interesting thing. </p>

<p>9.	Animation. (4 hours) Going back to number 8, combining the animation capabilities with a stick-figure I created.</p>

<p>10.	Combining a painting I created, or I like, with animation. (2 hours). Something that combines still life photography with Photoshop animation interacting with it would be cool. </p>
