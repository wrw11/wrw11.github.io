<p> Again, I only watched the videos at first, but after learning some of these essential skills I doodled on Photoshop for awhile, and since none of my drawings looked good I choose not to save them. I also tried re-drawing my own drawings in Photoshop. (I doodled for 1.5 hours or so.) </p>

<p> On 3/10 I created the Homer Simpson painting that is in my shared Box folder (4 hours). About an hour of that time was used find an old painting that could be satirically changed. </p>

<p>On 3/11 I attempted to change the Mona Lisa painting into something satirical as well (I wanted to add Kim Kardashian's face to it), but failed. I also tried to change Van Goh's "Starry Night" (by adding a flying Delorian), but was not happy with the result. (On both paintings, I didn't succesfully merge the two different styles well.  (2 hours.) </p>

<p> On 3/12 I watched videos about making cartoons on Photoshop and engaged in guided excercises along with the videos (3 hours).
