    <h2>POST 2--2/23</h2>
   

<p> In the past few days I’ve done the following: </p>

<p> On 2/20 From 3:00pm--3:30pm—I watched Lynda.com Exploring Layer Basics ( 8 minutes) </p>

<p> I watched Lynda.com Loading, Selecting, Transforming and Aligning (6 minutes) </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Working with layer groups (7 minutes) </p>

<p>I watched Lynda.com Merging and Flattening Layers (5 minutes) </p>

<p> Total: 26 minutes</p>

<p>Reflection: Since I will be combining multiple images to create my photoshopped piece, I think that it is important to understand how layers work. By having a mastery of layers and how they interact with one another in the program, I hope to avoid the layer technical difficulties that have plagued me in previous class work. </p>

<p>After viewing these videos, I now feel confident in my knowledge of how layers work. Admittedly, I have no experience in this matter so far (as I just watched the video and took notes), but I feel as though I have a baseline grasp of the skill.</p>

<p>On 2/21 From 10:00am--12:15pm—I watched Color and Brush essentials (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched working with layer masks (10 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched local pixel editing and retouching (15 minutes)</p>

<p>I watched Bleed mode essential (6 minutes) </p>

<p>Video Total: 40 Minutes </p>

<p> Again, I only watched the videos at first, but after learning some of these essential skills I doodled on Photoshop for awhile, and since none of my drawings looked good I choose not to save them. I also tried re-drawing my own drawings in Photoshop. (I doodled for 1.5 hours or so.) </p>

<p>On 2/22 from 5:00pm--5:30pm I watched Painting “Essentials” By Julieanne Kost  (25 Mins)</p>

<p>On 2/23 from 3:00pm--8:00pm—Experimentation: (5 hours) After watching the video the days before, I felt ready to try and re-create one of my past paintings because I thought it would be smart to simply recreate a painting at first (to learn how Photoshop works) before altering a masterpiece to make it funny or satirical. I choose to re-create an abstract painting I did awhile ago because I wanted to experiment with all the different brushes and color options. Soon after starting to paint in Photoshop, I realized how difficult painting abstractly is. I had a hard time blending colors naturally, and while it was simple enough to hit command z or the step backwards feature to restart, I was going nowhere. That is, until I started using layers. By putting a picture of my painting in one layer, putting another layer on top of it, then using the eye drop tool and  an acrylic paint set I downloaded off the internet, I was able to (sort of) recreate my painting. While I certainly “cheated” (because I ended up just painting over the colors on my past painting to create a new layer), I still had to do work of my own. I realized soon after that the new layer I created looked nothing like the painting I wanted, so I experimented with the mixer brush tool, the smudge tool, different paint brushes (specifically the splatter brush)-- I also reused portions of the background a few times. Below you can see the picture I painted with real paint, and the picture I painted in Photoshop</p>

    <p>Total time so far: Approximately 8 hours.</p>
