    <h2> Final Reflection </h2>

<p> From the start, I knew all of the work I wanted to do required Photoshop, so I thought it would be best if I parked myself at a desk in the computer lab often because those computers already had Photoshop downloaded and I work well in computer labs because, unlike when I’m in my dorm room, I’m not tempted to do anything else (such as listen to music, watch YouTube, etc.) </p>

<p> On the first day I went to the computer lab, and on many days after that, I watched some Photoshop tutorials, and while these videos were certainly helpful in some regards, I regret not having more time to fool around with the actual Photoshop software. Those videos on the first day, along with the many other videos I watched after that, were very helpful in teaching me how Photoshop works—and I learned a lot from them. I now feel I can navigate the interface well and I know which tools work best for a lot of situations, but I still wish I had more time to actually create things in the software. Out of my first ten hours, more than 1/4 of my time was spent watching tutorial videos, and it was only after my five hour experimentation session that I realized I learned best by actually trying to paint, draw, or create things—then failing to create them—then trying to do it again, failing again, getting frustrated, troubleshooting, trying again and, if I still had not figured it out yet (which I usually did by this point) I looked up a tutorial to help me. </p>

<p> This just goes to show that, for me, it was best to learn Photoshop through trial and error. By going in semi-blind, making mistakes, and then trying a new tool or tactic, I was able to learn the program much faster than by just watching videos of some expert working through Photoshop flawlessly. This is probably because of two things. First, I sometimes tend to doze off during videos that don’t interest me, and while the capabilities of Photoshop are intriguing, sometimes the technicalities involved can get a little dry. But most of all, Photoshop just has so many ways and tools to alter or create an image that I sometimes felt overwhelmed when learning about them all at once. If I was to do the first ten hours again, I’d probably watch just one video a day and learn about one new tool at a time, then implement that knowledge into my work gradually, instead of just watching a ton of videos and then trying to use everything I learned at once. </p>

<p> In my experiment session during my first ten hours, I tried to re-create an abstract painting of mine and I was happy with the result. It wasn’t a perfect match, of course, but both works had little things about them that I liked. Photoshop allowed me to use splatter brushes better than I could in real life, and by working with layers I could create a more in-depth and “layered” color scheme. However, the real life painting had some inconsistences and brush strokes that I struggled to re-create in the Photoshop software. For my last ten hours, I started off by having a similar three hour experiment session. This time, I set out to alter Vincent Van Goh’s painting called Sorrowing Old Man (At Eternity’s Gate) because I liked the painting and saw that it had potential for comedy. I turned the sorrowing man into Homer Simpson and implied that he was crying because of the newspaper on the floor next to him informing him of the start of prohibition. I am happy with this creation as well, and while I realize it’s not perfect, I am glad that I was able to accomplish my goal of combining a past art piece and pop culture to create humor. </p>

<p> After my three hour experimentation session, surprisingly I went back to a line of tutorial videos. But these ones were different. After spending some time watching Youtube videos for pleasure, a bunch of videos about painting, drawing, and coloring in Photoshop appeared in my suggestions, so I watched a little of the first one and really liked it. Instead of just showing me what tools did what, the people in these videos started with a blank Photoshop canvas and, if you worked alongside them (which you were supposed to do, and I did), by the end of the video you had created your own digital art. Most of the things I drew in Photoshop, thanks to these videos, were cartoon-ish and Anime-like, which is something I hadn’t even considered doing, but really liked. All in all, when I worked in Photoshop alongside the videos (sort of like what I did with painting and Bob Ross), I was able to learn new skills in a new medium I never had experience with before. Plus, most of the time I had a finished drawing by the end that I was proud of. </p>

<p> In sum, I was happy with what I got out of this skills assignment. I accomplished some of the goals I set out for myself and by the end of my hours I had found a new interest: Digital cartoons. </p>
