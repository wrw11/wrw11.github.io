    <p>Reflection Essay</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I am proud of the work I’ve done in this class. A lot of the work I did this semester dealt with combining two already established forms of media to create something new and satirical. I’ve never done this sort of thing before on the academic level and I had also never used Photoshop extensively before this class, but I now recognize its power and hope to use it again. From a writer’s standpoint, I also now further realize the power of combining words with other media, specifically images. In most of my assignments for this class I not only had to think of the right words to use, but the right images to accompany those words as well. In the grand scheme of things, then, I suppose for this class I thought of writing as a sort of means to an end. Specifically, with Photoshop pieces, I think audiences care more about—and pay more attention to—the images used, so if you’re going to use writing as well, the words you use have to have a purpose. And so I tried to keep this fact in mind when I created and revised my Photoshop creations.</p>
    
    <p>While all of my creations in this class did not have a satirical/comedic spin, a good amount of them were humorous. When presented with an assignment throughout this semester, most of the time I asked myself how I could do something funny. There were notable exceptions, of course—such as my dark, creepy, raw soundscape, my storyboard about J.D Salinger’s battle with potential filmmakers about public domain and copyright law regarding his novel, The Catcher in the Rye, and my Photoshop re-creation of my own original artwork—but the rest of the time, I tried to make people laugh. In the very beginning of the semester, I wrote a funny Craigslist ad about a man named Mike, who felt like he had a missed connection with singer Adele. And from then on out I mostly focused on comedy. I created a funny-ish “About Me” section on my website, I Photoshopped Homer Simpson into a Vincent Van Goh painting, I created a movie poster that combined the movies “IT” and “Singin’ in the Rain,” and I created another movie poster with The Beatles’ heads on silverware. I think the main reason I gravitated towards creating humorous media is because I enjoy making myself laugh. But in addition to that, like I said before in my Work-in-Progress 2 reflection, since I am only a Photoshop novice, I found it hard to create a serious, dramatic, or horrific creation without people laughing at the images technical problems. I just did not want to try and create a serious thing that would end up so much worse than what I had envisioned it to be. And in all honesty, I regret not taking risks in this area, but I am not devastated about it. Thanks to this class I learned new skills and I can always just open Photoshop in my free time and try to create something serious, dramatic, or horrific. </p>
    
    <p>In regards to the people who visit my website or look at my portfolio, I hope that they’ll enjoy the humorous pieces, and I also hope that they’ll respect my efforts when it comes to my more serious creations. Like I said, I found it harder to create the more serious works, and in regards to them, I am only truly proud of my Photoshop re-creation of my original painting. I revised this painting a second time for my final portfolio and I think this version rivals my original, hand-painted one. I just like how I made the colors pop using adjustments, specifically hue/saturation.</p>
    
    <p>In regards to class readings, I really liked how a lot of the things we read dealt with real world topics, and I can definitely see how I’d apply some of the principles we learned to the real world—especially if I worked in marketing. Most reading sections impacted my work, but the section dealing with modal considerations in Writer/Designer: A Guide to Making Multimodal Projects really struck a chord with me. The following quotation sums up modal considerations well: “The gender of the announcer and the tone, volume, and other qualities of his or her voice reflect whom the advertiser is trying to reach. The choice of whether to use video or animation, color or black and white, slow motion or other special effects, are all deliberate modal considerations based on what the advertiser is trying to sell and to whom. Although each mode plays a role in the overall message, it is the combination of modes—the multimodality—that creates the full piece of communication” (Page 4 of Writer/Designer). While I of course had to make many modal considerations for all of my creations, I find it easiest now to talk about the considerations I made for the satirical Homer Simpson/Vincent Van Goh picture I created in Photoshop. I think modal considerations are extremely important in satire and comedy. In my case, it was important to not be too blunt with the joke. Subtlety was key. Most of the “narrative” of my picture is told through images only, making it so the audience has to figure out things for themselves. They also have to know that Homer Simpson likes to drink beer, which is the reason he’s crying after learning of prohibition from the newspaper next to him. Now, after typing this I realized how un-funny the joke is if I have to explain it—and this plays right into the topic of modal considerations. Jokes need subtly sometimes, and there’s no better way to achieve subtly than through images or another modal consideration that makes you “work” for the punchline of a joke.</p>
    
    <p>In the end, I think this class was an enjoyable experience. I especially liked the in-class exercises and assignments, where I could ask you for help and work with my peers on a shared goal. I also thought my writing reached a new level. I now think of audience more often than I used to. Before, the most important component of my writing process was finding a way to entertain myself, especially if the writing I did was non-academic—and, if it was academic and there was room in the rubric for creativity (like all of your assignments), I also tried to entertain myself. Now, though, I think I care more about what an audience expects/likes. And while I don’t think it is good to always cater to an audience, it’s important to be aware of what people expect/like—especially if you’re going to subvert their expectations, be it through jokes or other means. </p>
