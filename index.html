    <p>Will Witte is a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. 
      He’s majoring in Fiction Writing and Public and Professional Writing (in case writing novels for a living doesn’t work out and he has to get a real job). 
      Will grew up in Pittsburgh and likes all of the city’s sports teams, 
      and he has a slight Pittsburghese accent that goes away if he wants to impress a job recruiter or his girlfriend’s mother.
    Will has three younger brothers and, as the oldest sibling, was always getting in trouble for something he didn't do. In addition to writing,
    Will likes to paint and is a big fan of Bob Ross.
