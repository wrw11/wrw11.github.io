    <h2>Work-in-Progress 2 Reflection</h2>

<p> I really liked what my group did for the “Genre Association and Representation” in-class assignment, so I decided to work with that Photoshop image for this work-in-progress assignment. In class, we combined the movies “It” and “Singin’ in the Rain” to create a comedic movie poster entitled: “Singin’ in the Drain.” And while I was happy with the things we got done in class, I knew parts of the image were a little rough around the edges, which made it a perfect project for revision. </p>

<p> My goal for this final revision was to make the "Singin' in the Drain" movie poster look as professional as possible. After getting out of class and coming back to the original image my group and I created, I wasn’t happy with the way we just copied and pasted the people from “Singin’ in the Drain.” I wasn’t happy with how we incorporated them into the movie poster. I thought their inclusion looked a little too cartoon-ish, and wanted to create a more realistic and professional image. So, one of the first things I did was to find real-life pictures of Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. When I found pictures of them that would work well, I re-sized them so their heads would be around the same size as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, to make it seem like they were in the sewer with him. Then I erased parts of Gene Kelly’s and Debbie Reynolds’ pictures using the magic eraser, so only their heads and shoulders were left before placing them next to Pennywise the Dancing Clown, who remained the same. After this, I soon realized that I needed to make Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds faces much darker and more ominous to match the tone Pennywise the Dancing Clown has. I used the brightness/contrast tool to do just that. </p>

<p> I also wasn’t happy with the text used in our first image, so I completely erased all of the text we had and started over. I wanted the text to be uniform, and it wasn’t in the beginning. I also thought the dark grass above the sewer, which was basically just a blank space, was an eye sore, so I added the actor’s names there and am happy with the result. Besides that, I did a few other cosmetic additions (such as putting Debbie Reynolds behind the balloon, instead of putting the balloon behind Debbie, like in the original—as well as creating a uniform color scheme. I used the eye drop tool match the colors in the image with the colors I used for all of the text. </p>

<p> All in all, I’m happy with the final result. I think my movie poster is comedic only because of the subject material I included. The play on words—Singin’ in the Drain—probably gets a laugh out of some people, but I think my poster also has an ominous quality to it as well. But, because of the comedic aspects, I bet people would hesitate to describe this “potential” movie as horror, instead they’d think it was comedy or parody. In the end, I guess this movie poster brought simply characters from “Singin’ in the Rain” into It’s world, and not the other way around </p>

<p> In regards to the other in-class assignments so far, I have come to realize that my first step in the creative process is to think of something funny and see if I can translate that thought into what I’m doing. My other Photoshop piece—which had the Beatles heads on silverware, to mimic the potential movie poster entitled “The Beatles Meet the Giant”—was an attempt at comedy, just like “Singin’ in the Drain” was. However, my soundscape was not an attempt at comedy. I’m not really sure what it was. Unlike the other projects I created for this class, the soundscape was the least realized. It had horror aspects, of course, and I was happy with the first thirty seconds or so, when I tried to capture an “on-your-deathbed-feeling.” All in all, while I considered revising my soundscape, I ended up not doing so because I enjoy using Photoshop more than audacity—but I do hope to revisit that soundscape I made one day. I still need to add a new ending. </p>

<p> In regards to the future, I hope to continue making and/or revising comedic pieces. I think that is where I am most talented, especially in Photoshop. At this point, I do not think I am talented enough to create a more serious, dramatic, or horrific work without people laughing at it, which isn’t my attention. Through parody, and combining two works that have already been created, I am able “cheat the system” by only combining and making things funnier, and not creating from scratch—which is a hard thing to do in Photoshop. I have tried, and it’s only gone alright. </p>
