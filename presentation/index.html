    <h2>Work-in-progress 2</h2>
    <p> I really liked what my group did for the “Genre Association and Representation” in-class assignment, so I decided to work with that Photoshop image for this work-in-progress assignment. In class, we combined the movies “It” and “Singin’ in the Rain” to create a comedic movie poster entitled: “Singin’ in the Drain.” And while I was happy with the things we got done in class, I knew parts of the image were a little rough around the edges, which made it a perfect project for revision. </p>

<p> My goal for this final revision was to make the movie poster look as professional as possible. After getting out of class and coming back to the image, I wasn’t happy with the way my group and I just copied and pasted the people from “Singin’ in the Drain.” I thought it looked too cartoon-ish, and wanted to create a more realistic image. So, one of the first things I did was to find real-life pictures of Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, then I correctly sized them, erased parts of the original image I didn’t need, and put them in next to Pennywise the Dancing Clown, who remained the same. I soon realized that I needed to make Gene and Debbie darker and more ominous to match the tone Pennywise has. I used brightness/contrast tool to do just that. </p>

<p> I also wasn’t happy with the text used in our first image, so I completely erased all of the text we had and started over. I wanted the text to be uniform, and it wasn’t in the beginning. I also thought the dark grass above the sewer, which was basically just a blank space, was an eye sore, so I added the actor’s names there and am happy with the result. Besides that, I did a few other cosmetic additions (such as putting Debbie Reynolds behind the balloon, instead of putting the balloon behind Debbie, like in the original—as well as creating a uniform color scheme: using the eye drop tool match the colors in the image with the colors I used for all of the text.

<p> All in all, I’m happy with the final result. I think my movie poster is comedic only because of the subject material I included. The play on words—Singin’ in the Drain—probably gets a laugh out of some, but I think my poster also has an ominous quality to it as well. I guess what I’m trying to say is I brought the characters from “Singin’ in the Rain” into It’s world, and not the other way around. </p>

<p> In regards to the other in-class assignments so far, I have come to realize that my first step in the creative process is to think of something funny and see if I can translate into what I’m doing. My other Photoshop piece—which had the Beatles heads on silverware—was an attempt at comedy, however, my soundscape was not an attempt at comedy. I was happy with the first thirty seconds or so of my soundscape, which tried to capture an “on-your-deathbed-feeling.” While I considered revising my soundscape, I didn’t because I enjoy using Photoshop better than audacity—but I do hope to revisit that soundscape one day. I still need to add a new ending. </p>
