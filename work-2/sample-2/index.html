    <h2>Week 4 Writing Sample</h2>
    <p>Craigslist Post:
Missed Connections.
 
My name’s Mike and this is meant for the talented singer Adele. 
I heard she went on Craigslist once, so here it goes: I know your name, Adele, but you don’t know mine. 
      It’s Mike. And I was at your concert last night in Pittsburgh and I sat in the front row. 
      You didn’t look at me then, but I feel like if you had it would have been love at first sight. 
      I’m posting on Craiglist’s missed connection section today, in the hopes that you’ll call me tomorrow. 
      My phone number is: 867-5309. :)
