    <h2>Written Reflection???</h2>

    <h2>Week 1 Writing Sample (Craigslist Post)</h2>
    <p>Missed Connections: My name’s Mike and this is meant for the talented singer Adele. 
      I heard she went on Craigslist once, so here it goes: I know your name, Adele, but you don’t know mine. 
      It’s Mike. And I was at your concert last night in Pittsburgh and I sat in the front row. 
      You didn’t look at me then, but I feel like if you had it would have been love at first sight. 
      I’m posting on Craiglist’s missed connection section today, in the hopes that you’ll call me tomorrow. 
      My phone number is: 867-5309. :) </p>
    
    <h2>Week 4 Writing Sample (Design Concept)</h2>
     <p>I’m from Pittsburgh and I want my website to reflect that. 
       So, at first thought, I wanted my website’s color scheme to be black and gold (for the Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates),
       but then I realized that putting black text over a gold background (or vice-versa) would not look good,
       so I think I’ll add another color: Grey, which will be the dominant or background color.
       I think I’ll still have the text be only black, but I’ll use gold for effect, perhaps to shadow or highlight something.</p>
    <p>In regards to spatial layout, I like websites that are simple or minimalist because I think they are easier to navigate 
      and I like how the content is not fighting each other for my attention. 
      I like websites that grab my attention with only a few pictures, rather than websites that overwhelm me with tons of pictures 
      and accompanying text or content. So, in line with this, I want my own website’s pictures to adhere to the following motto: 
      Sparse but awesome to look at. I’d rather show people only a few great photos rather than show them a dozen okay photos 
      taken from google images.</p>
    <p>In regards to written content, I want my website to be funny but not stupid. I’m a big fan of subtle humor, 
      but I don’t want my website to be only about cracking jokes, so humor will be sprinkled in here and there.</p>
       <p>For inspiration, I want to look at one of my favorite artist’s website. 
         The artist is Burton Morris and the website is burtonmorris.com.
         On his website there are only good pictures, not any bad ones, and while he does have a lot of pictures, 
         he utilizes a scrolling feature that lets people see a few paintings at a time. 
         By the end of the semester I hope to have enough good pictures and illustrations to include a scrolling feature. 
         Another motto I want to follow (and one that Burton Morris follows as well) is: 
         I want my website to be basic but impressive. (Basic in its design, with no useless bells and whistles, 
         but impressive in the material it presents for a visitor to see online).</p>
