    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <h2>Written Reflection???</h2>
    <p>To be honest, I struggled at first with HTML and CSS. 
      It took me awhile to just get the basic “wire-frame” of my site down, 
      but thanks to some instructor advice and w3schools.com, which has useful guides, 
      I was able to trudge through the process, and I am happy with how my site looks now.</p>
     <p>In regards to some specific revisions, 
       I knew early on that I wanted to get rid of the ugly blue hyperlink text that appears when a link is clicked. 
       Luckily, w3schools.com had a tutorial on just that. 
       After I changed the ugly blue text to a black underline style I liked, 
       I set off to implement a color scheme for my website. 
       At first I tried black text on a gold background, but I didn’t like it. 
       Then I tried gold text on a black background, and I hated that even more. 
       So I thought about introducing a third color and decided grey would work well, 
       but when I changed the background to the stock CSS “grey,” 
       I found that the site looked too stagnant and monotonous. 
       So I went back to the drawing board and decided that a wallpaper grey image, 
       found on google images, would work well for my website because it is cool looking and subtle, 
       and it doesn’t drown out the text. Putting in that background image wasn’t too hard, 
       because w3schools.com had a tutorial.</p>
    <p>After putting in a background I liked, my site still looked monotonous. 
      It was simply black text on a grey background, so in sticking with my Pittsburgh color scheme, 
      I decided to put a gold text-shadow on my site’s title: Will Witte’s Website. 
      I thought it added much needed color, but soon after decided that even more color was needed. 
      At this point, I had already revised my “About Me” statement, 
      so below it I thought adding a picture of me at a Steelers game would both add color 
      (keeping up with the Pittsburgh theme), and allow visitors to see who Will Witte actually is. </p>
    <p>Adding the picture was easy enough thanks to w3schools.com, 
      but after I was done I realized that the “About Me” section was a little insufficient at telling a visitor 
      what I am like in real life. It’s not that I think the content for the “About Me” is bad or anything, 
      it’s just written by me. And I’m biased towards making myself look good (or funny) 
      so I thought it best to put up a few links to my Facebook, 
      Twitter and LinkedIn pages to allow a visitor to “follow” me in the real world.</p>
     <p>After putting up the social media links, I realized that while my site had a lot of the content I wanted, it didn’t look that good. So, with the help of w3schools.com, I changed the font, fixed the spacing, tinkered with the padding, and centered things to make the spatial layout of my site better. Then I added a funny footer. Because I was tired of looking at the example “My Footer” I had before. All in all, I’m proud of the website I built, but want to add more pictures to it.
</p>
    <p>Because pictures are what I care about. I want to my website to have the coolest images of my artwork, other people’s artwork, photographs, anything. This is why, in the near future, I want to learn about the different ways one can put images on a site in a “scrolling” fashion, where a visitor can click a button and scroll through a bunch of images. I also want to learn some HTML and CSS animation techniques. While I was scrolling through things to learn at w3schools.com, I found a section on animation, but the step-by-step tutorial was intimidating. Despite the challenge, I hope by the end of the semester I will have at least one piece of animation on my website. Furthermore, I want to learn how to implement videos onto my website, specifically YouTube videos. I also would like my site to have more social media capabilities. I noticed that on your site you had your twitter feed as a right side bar it looked like. Creating something similar on my website is another goal of mine. Integrating social media is a huge priority for me because right now, there is no way for visitors to my website to get in contact with me besides e-mail. Having a way to converse with potential visitor is a must-have for a website, in my opinion.

    <h2>Week 1 Writing Sample (Craigslist Post)</h2>
    <p>Missed Connections: My name’s Mike and this is meant for the talented singer Adele. 
      I heard she went on Craigslist once, so here it goes: I know your name, Adele, but you don’t know mine. 
      It’s Mike. And I was at your concert last night in Pittsburgh and I sat in the front row. 
      You didn’t look at me then, but I feel like if you had it would have been love at first sight. 
      I’m posting on Craiglist’s missed connection section today, in the hopes that you’ll call me tomorrow. 
      My phone number is: 867-5309. :) </p>
    
    <h2>Week 4 Writing Sample (Design Concept)</h2>
     <p>I’m from Pittsburgh and I want my website to reflect that. 
       So, at first thought, I wanted my website’s color scheme to be black and gold (for the Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates),
       but then I realized that putting black text over a gold background (or vice-versa) would not look good,
       so I think I’ll add another color: Grey, which will be the dominant or background color.
       I think I’ll still have the text be only black, but I’ll use gold for effect, perhaps to shadow or highlight something.</p>
    <p>In regards to spatial layout, I like websites that are simple or minimalist because I think they are easier to navigate 
      and I like how the content is not fighting each other for my attention. 
      I like websites that grab my attention with only a few pictures, rather than websites that overwhelm me with tons of pictures 
      and accompanying text or content. So, in line with this, I want my own website’s pictures to adhere to the following motto: 
      Sparse but awesome to look at. I’d rather show people only a few great photos rather than show them a dozen okay photos 
      taken from google images.</p>
    <p>In regards to written content, I want my website to be funny but not stupid. I’m a big fan of subtle humor, 
      but I don’t want my website to be only about cracking jokes, so humor will be sprinkled in here and there.</p>
       <p>For inspiration, I want to look at one of my favorite artist’s website. 
         The artist is Burton Morris and the website is burtonmorris.com.
         On his website there are only good pictures, not any bad ones, and while he does have a lot of pictures, 
         he utilizes a scrolling feature that lets people see a few paintings at a time. 
         By the end of the semester I hope to have enough good pictures and illustrations to include a scrolling feature. 
         Another motto I want to follow (and one that Burton Morris follows as well) is: 
         I want my website to be basic but impressive. (Basic in its design, with no useless bells and whistles, 
         but impressive in the material it presents for a visitor to see online).</p>
